input_reader
============

A python module to facilitate reading input files
-------------------------------------------------

``input_reader`` is used to define and read a general input file for a program.
This ``README`` only contains a *brief* synopsis of what ``input_reader`` can
do.  For a more detailed description of the API, please see the documentation
at [coming soon!  I promise!].  The API is inspired by that of the ``argparse``
module from the python standard library, so hopefully it will be easy to learn.

The Problem

Let's say you have to write a program that cooks a meal.
